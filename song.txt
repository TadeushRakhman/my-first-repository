She was born with a song in the air
In the summer of '85
The clouds just went
And the day became so bright
A child of love angel like
With the most beautiful smile
Growing up to be the sunshine of my life
Come talk to me
Don't run away
Don't let the distance grow
The door's wide open
Don't ever think
There is no way home
Sly, come home tonight
The world is so bad you drive 'em all mad
With your smile
Oh, sly, my joy my pride
When the runaway train take you away
A part of me died
